# INDIAN_FOOD_ANALYSIS_VISUALIZATION

I have done Data Analysis on INDIAN_FOOD dataset.

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like Plotly, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, etc for analysis.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

## Content

**Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism, cultural choices and traditions.*-**

__This dataset consists of information about various Indian dishes, their ingredients, their place of origin, etc.__
